# trackeR

trackeR aims to provide infrastructure for GPS tracker data from cycling and running. Currently, it includes tools to import, visualise and analyse such GPS tracker data in form of .tcx and .db3 files. For converting other formats to .tcx, [this blog post](http://www.dcrainmaker.com/tools) might be helpful.
