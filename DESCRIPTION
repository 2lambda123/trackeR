Description: trackeR provides infrastructure for handling cycling and running data from GPS-enabled tracking devices. After extraction and appropriate manipulation of the training or competition attributes, the data are placed into session-aware data objects with an S3 class trackeRdata. The information in the resultant data objects can then be visualised, summarised and analysed through corresponding flexible and extensible methods.
