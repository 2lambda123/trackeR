Description: The aim of this package is to provide infrastructure for
    handling running and cycling data from GPS-enabled tracking
    devices. After extraction and appropriate manipulation of the
    training or competition attributes, the data are placed into
    session-based and unit-aware data objects of class 'trackeRdata'
    (S3 class). The information in the resulting data objects can then
    be visualised, summarised, and analysed through corresponding
    flexible and extensible methods. A shiny dashboard is provided
    (type 'trackeR_app()') that implements a workflow for the extraction and
    analysis of the data.
